## Recommendations

### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* Offer 0.20% trades similar to Coinsmart and NDAX, but keep cashing out from Crypto to Fiat at 0.50%. [^5]
* Offer 0.10% bonus on transfers that come in from other platforms. 
..* I am making up this number for the sake of providing an idea to contemplate. 
..* A business case could be studied that seeks to understanding what the probability is for a user to make a trade or cash out from Crypto to Fiat within a given time period from transfering in Crypto currencies fom another platform.


### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* Coinsmart and NDAX offer 0.20% trading fees so it would make them more competative. [^5]
* Offering a 0.10% bonus on transfers coming in from other platforms would be a first in the market move over its competitors. 
* It would generate interst that could transfer into an increase to its user and active user base. 
* Eventually the other platforms might come out with their own offerings but being the first in the market to do so it would generate opportunity that any successor would miss.

### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Anaconda

### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

* Analyzing data to help with decision making.
